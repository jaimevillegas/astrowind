      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">About me</h2>
      <p>
        As an engineer, I learned to build things that work. As a developer, I learned to build things that people love to use.

        My dual profile allows me to approach each project from two angles: the technical soundness of engineering and the empathy of user-centered design. The result is efficient, scalable web applications with a flawless user experience.
