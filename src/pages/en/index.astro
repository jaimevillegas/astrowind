        <div class="text-lg dark:text-slate-400 text-left space-y-4">
          <p>
            My career began in <span class="text-orange-600 font-bold">engineering</span>, where I learned the discipline of building things that simply work—robustly and predictably. That analytical foundation is my starting point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, as a <span class="text-orange-600 font-bold">developer</span>, I discovered my passion: building things that people love to use. I understood that behind every `&lt;div&gt;` there's a person, and that empathy for the end user is as crucial as an efficient algorithm.
          </p>
          <p>
            This duality is my working method. I combine <span class="text-orange-600 font-bold">technical soundness</span> with <span class="text-orange-600 font-bold">user-centered design</span> to not only deliver a product that works, but an intuitive and satisfying digital experience.
          </p>
